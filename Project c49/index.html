                        Pigeons are incredibly complex and intelligent animals. They are one of only a small number of
                        species to pass the ‘mirror test’ – a test of self recognition.
                    </li>
                    <li> Pigeons are renowned for their outstanding navigational abilities. They use a range of skills,
                        such as using the sun as a guide and an internal ‘magnetic compass’. </li>
                    <li>Pigeons can fly at altitudes up to and beyond 6000 feet, and at an average speed of 77.6 mph.
                        The fastest recorded speed is 92.5 mph.</li>
                    <li>Pigeons are highly sociable animals. They will often be seen in flocks of 20-30 birds.</li>

                        Cicadas can survive a huge fall as babies, or nymphs. They are about the size of a grain of rice
                        when they drop from a tree branch to the ground and start digging.
                    </li>
                    <li> The loud whirring or buzzing sound you hear is an all-male cicada chorus.Cicadas don’t sing at
                        night, so don’t blame them if you can’t sleep.</li>
                    <li>Females may be attracted to the sound of motors. So you get to watch your dad, mom or older
                        sibling get swarmed while they’re using the lawn mower or power tools.</li>
                    <li>They’re true bugs (from the order Hemiptera). So you can call them a bug and be scientifically
                        accurate.</li>
